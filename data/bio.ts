  `Pietro Montanti composes music for film and visual media—where sound becomes story.

A classically-trained clarinetist turned composer, he specializes in the invisible art: scores that elevate narrative without stealing focus. His work spans short films, theatre productions, and international music libraries, always guided by one principle: serve the story, honor the cut, trust the silence.

Based between Italy and the world's post-production suites, Pietro works from spotting sessions to final mix—fast, focused, and obsessively organized. Because when picture locks, the music must already be there.`;
