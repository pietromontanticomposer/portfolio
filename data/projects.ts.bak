    description: `Claudio Re is a short film directed by Marco Martini, inspired by Hamlet and centered on the psychological unraveling of King Claudius after committing murder to secure his throne.
  The score employs a dark hybrid orchestral language, blending traditional orchestration with ancient instruments to create a tense, timeless atmosphere.
  Both composition and dark, restrained mix were shaped to emphasize the film's black-and-white imagery, reinforcing Claudius' guilt and paranoia and amplifying his fear of being killed in turn. The music acts as an internal pressure, exposing the fracture between his public authority and inner collapse.`,

    description: `Soggetto Obsoleto is a short film directed by Nicola Pegg, set in a dystopian society where individuals are periodically evaluated according to their social usefulness and risk being declared "obsolete."
  The score is deliberately absent throughout most of the film and enters only in the final section, during the closing dialogue between father and son.
  Music is used as a moment of emotional revelation, introducing intimacy and humanity after prolonged restraint, and marking a clear contrast between the impersonal system that governs the story and the private bond at its core.`,

  I composed the music for the battle sequences and the ritual banquet scenes, working on two distinct registers: on one side a tighter, more rhythmic writing to support the conflict, on the other a more ceremonial and evocative musical framework for communal moments.
  The score accompanies the cinematic reconstructions, reinforcing the epic tone of the story while maintaining narrative clarity and an educational purpose.`,

    description: `I Found You is an independent horror film directed by Diego Carli, set in an abandoned villa where two young girls engage in a seemingly innocent game that gradually reveals its dangerous nature.
  The score follows a classic horror underscore approach, designed to support the slow transition from innocence to unease, focusing on underlying tension rather than overt shocks.
  The music works through restraint and subtle development, enhancing silence, anticipation, and small timbral shifts to intensify the sense of threat without pre-empting the visual narrative.`,

  The score is built around a main leitmotif associated with the Banshee, which returns throughout the film in different forms and orchestrations, adapting to the protagonist's narrative and psychological shifts.
  Alongside this central theme, I developed secondary leitmotifs tied to characters and phases of the story, creating a coherent musical structure that follows the short's emotional evolution without resorting to redundant commentary`,

    description: `Free / Fall is a short film directed by Francesco La Barbera and Daniele Murgia, exploring gambling addiction through the subjective collapse of a young man trapped in a repetitive cycle of compulsion and avoidance.
  The score is built around synths, piano and strings, shifting between major and minor tonalities to mirror the dopamine highs and emotional lows characteristic of addiction. In moments of heightened internal conflict, these harmonic shifts are deliberately dissonant against the surrounding melodic material, generating friction that reflects the character’s psychological instability.
  The music makes frequent use of dominant seventh harmonies that resolve back onto the same chord, creating a sensation of apparent resolution that never truly moves forward. This harmonic loop reinforces the illusion of control and relief typical of addictive behavior. Underlying synth drones act as a persistent noise floor, representing the unresolved inner pressure the character attempts to suppress. The score avoids true catharsis, aligning with the film’s ending as the character ultimately returns to gambling.`,

    description: `Polvere sotto al tappeto is a dramatic horror short film directed by Gianluca Volpe, centered on a man who murders his partner after discovering her betrayal and constructs a network of narcissistic justifications to legitimize his act.
  The narrative unfolds entirely from the protagonist’s subjective perspective, with the voice in his head taking the form of his murdered partner, collapsing guilt, denial and self-absolution into a single distorted inner dialogue.
  The score aligns with this corrupted point of view: the music appears ordered, controlled and deceptively positive, suggesting clarity and emotional balance where none truly exist. By adopting the protagonist’s internal logic, the music amplifies the psychological horror, exposing the fracture between apparent rationality and moral collapse.`,
